# fun_with_emitters
Just working with event emitters/basic chat app

# Welcome to ChatLand
This is a basic chat app playing around with websockets, it includes chat rooms and users, though it doesn't have a signup stage. You can enter a chat room by entering a room name (it will default to 'General'), and you can enter your own name as seen here:
[start a chat](readme_images/join)

# Share your location
One of the features implemented is the ability to share your location if shared with the browser, as seen here:
[share location](readme_images/chat_location)

# How to setup

`npm install`
`npm start`

It should start at localhost:3000, and you can navigate there to begin chatting. There are also a few basic tests built which can be accessed with `npm test`


Work in progress- basic web app using websockets.
